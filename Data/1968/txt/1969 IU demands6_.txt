"In keeping with these traditional policies, the Trustees recognize that educational opportunity, academic freedom and the right to dissent peaceably cannot be persevered in an environment of force and violence or the threat of force and violence which interferes with, or disrupts or obstructs the work and activities of the University or members of the University community. Such a climate is created by the unauthorized seizure and occupation of the University community of the fall use fo such facilities for their intended purpose, and of like effect are the use of intimidation, coercion, or the physical restraint or threatening of persons.

"In the light of the fact that such events have occurred in a number of academic communities in recent weeks, The Trustees of Indiana University are constrained to make plain their support of the officials of the University in the firm enforcement of University policies and rules relating to picketing, demonstrating and related matters; and we recognize and affirm the necessity to take immediate steps to expel, under established procedures, any students who (1), actively engages in any conduct which includes violence or the threat of violence and which obstructs or disrupts University work or activity, or (2), who engages in conduct which usurps University property or facilities; and, further, we reaffirm the necessity to take immediate steps to impose appropriate discipline, including expulsion, under established procedures, upon any student who engages in conduct which unreasonably interferes with the freedom of movement of persons on any campus of the University."

The policy was unanimously reaffirmed, on motion duly made and seconded.
