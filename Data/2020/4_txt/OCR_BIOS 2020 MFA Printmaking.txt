In response to the statement from BIOS leadership regarding racial injustice, we, the undersigned graduate students and postdoctoral researchers of this department, would like to continue this conversation. While the condemnation of overt violence and oppression against Black people and other persecuted groups is absolutely necessary, this is also a time to actively confront the systemic ways in which racism has structured our own community. We have taken the first steps of reflection and evaluation as advocated for in your letter and we now implore our department leadership to take the next actionable steps as outlined at the end of this letter.
 We would specifically like to address past and current efforts towards the hiring, retention, and promotion of Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) at the faculty level. Currently, the faculty in our department is composed of only 23% People of Color and 30% women, with no Black or Indigenous faculty representation. While this representation is unfortunately the status quo for biology departments across the US (Li & Koedel 2017), this does not reflect a department deeply committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive community. Further, the visible record of recent hiring and promotion depicts an institution that, at best, does not recognize or support the talents of BIPOC and women faculty, and, at worst, actively penalizes the additional emotional and mental labor and service that BIPOC and women faculty often participate in. This visible record, and the message we are hearing from it, impedes the training and development of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. 
 A more diverse faculty body is beneficial to trainees in several ways. First, diverse groups are more effective at problem solving than homogeneous groups, which could directly increase the productivity and scientific development of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers (Phillips et al. 2014). Second, as many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows identify as BIPOC or underrepresented minorities, our development as scientists is improved when the group of faculty responsible for our training represents diverse backgrounds with differing perspectives (Yehia et al. 2014). Third, given that BIPOC faculty, women faculty, and queer faculty are disproportionately underrepresented at the full professor level, a department that actively fights against this leaky pipeline phenomenon could have positive, downstream effects on graduate students pursuing academic careers. Overall, faculty representation is a direct signal of the attributes and traits of scientists valued by the department, and, without it, both current and prospective trainees hear a message unaligned with an appreciation of diversity and inclusion. 
 To actively promote anti-racist recruitment and retention in the department, we are requesting department leadership and faculty take action in four specific ways:
1) Develop a new statement on our departments stance on Diversity with actionable efforts to improve recruitment and retention of BIPOC faculty.
2) Initiate a Diversity and Inclusion committee, including graduate student representatives
3) Require all department members attend cultural sensitivity and implicit bias training, provided by an external source such as SheGeeksOut or the Racial Equity Institute, annually
4) Participate and support June 10s Shut Down Stem Initiative, with the intention of using this day as a starting point for continued action at the level of the individual, lab, department, and wider community 
 The actions we are requesting are a starting point for what we hope will be joint-work towards long-term systematic efforts to combat racism and implicit bias in the department. Next week, we would like to continue this conversation at the University level with Dean Mary Galvin, Associate Provost Laura Carlson, and Provost Marie Lynn Miranda. We hope for your support in furthering this conversation. 
 Respectfully, 
 
 
Specifically, it is important for graduate students and postdocs to have diverse faculty mentors so that we have role models, mentors, and [something about examples of success - of URMs making it through the leaky pipeline and succeeding].

 
Our goals in this statement are to 1) express our dissatisfaction in past and current faculty-level initiatives to include diverse voices in our community and 2) provide concrete objectives to promote actively anti-racist recruitment and improve diversity and inclusion at the faculty level.

 
 
 We have evaluated the state of diversity in our department and are unsatisfied with our current status. Currently, the faculty in our department is composed of only 30% women and 23% People of Color, with no Black or Indigenous faculty representation. While this representation is unfortunately the status quo for biology departments across the US (Li & Koedel 2017), if we are truly striving to be an inclusive and diverse department we should have representation higher than the average. Unfortunately, as things stand, the diversity of our graduate student and postdoctoral population is not reflected in the diversity of our faculty. 
 We have evaluated the hiring and retention of Black people, People of Color, and members of other underrepresented groups and we are unsatisfied with this department's efforts. Despite a diverse range of candidates, the last five hires for faculty positions in ecology have been white men. While graduate students are often asked to participate in the interviewing process (e.g., presenting graduate student feedback at faculty meetings), how our feedback on candidates values of diversity, inclusivity, and mentoring is actually used in the hiring process is unclear. We also recognize that of the last six faculty that went up for tenure, the only two that were awarded their promotion were white men. Unfortunately, our understanding of the hiring and tenure process in our department is limited due to lack of transparency, leaving us to postulate why these decisions are made.

 Diversity at all levels, from undergraduate students to faculty, is critical for fostering a department that champions diversity and inclusion. As things stand, the diversity of our graduate student and postdoctoral population is not reflected in the diversity of our faculty. 


As stated in your letter, you have asked for self-reflection and -evaluation. 
 P2: the importance of diversity 
 Having diverse faculty to support a diverse grad student body as role models and mentors
 ND biology has structured their department in a way that forces graduate students to see URM faculty as tokens. When there is 1 BIPOC or 1 LGBTQIA+ or 1 Black person or 1 etc. etc. etc. then that shows to graduate students that to be in a department you have to compete with all other people that look like you if youre URM. There NEEDS to be more examples of BIPOC + in the department if they expect their BIPOC + graduate students to think that they can go on to be faculty somewhere. 
- Does this thought process make sense I think Im having a hard time getting the succinct message across
- This also places an unfair weight on 1 or few representatives, requiring them to act as unofficial mentors for students who identify with them and want to seek guidance (not the fault of the students or anything). This can end up placing extra responsibility/time demands/emotional burden on minority faculty that others dont see or experience. 
 this describes this phenomenon as cognitive load and I think thats a nice phrase we could use
 P3: On the retention and hiring of Black people, People of Color, and members of other underrepresented groups in academia, we are unsatisfied with this department's efforts. 
 Current state of dept
 30% of research faculty in department are women
 22.6% of all faculty (including teaching) could be identified as POC, no Black or Indigenous scholars [23.2% of research faculty or 20% of teaching] link to rough spreadsheet
 Here is a PDF I found on furthering inclusivity in academia (Look at Appendix C for faculty diversity)
 A quick comparison to other university biology departments (Li & Koedel 2017): 23 public universities biology department faculty breakdown (2015-2016 academic year): 31.1% female, 16.7% POC (12.9% Asian, 0.7% Black, 3.0% Hispanic, 0.1% Other) 
 Li, D., & Koedel, C. (2017). Representation and salary gaps by race-ethnicity and gender at selective public universities. Educational Researcher, 46(7), 343-354.
 The point here being we are basically doing just the average. However, if we are striving to be known as a diverse and inclusive department, we should be far better than the average
 P4: Efforts mean nothing if they fail. - Can include that they cant hide behind the fact that they try to hire faculty of color but they dont come here - thats bc this is a terrible department for diversity and inclusion
 If BIPOC are not coming (whether applying or accepting if they get offers) here, it likely indicates a failure of the dept to do enough to draw them here - if were perceived to be non-diverse, non-inclusive environment (almost definitely true), we will continue to be 
 Also they interview BIPOC, but often times they dont actually make any offers to them. Its like their interviewing them is just a front. 
 Last 5 hires in ecology have been white men 
 Jones, Rocha, Perkins, Medvigy, Rohr
 The department needs to actually PRIORITIZE diversity - its evidently not enough to say IF they apply we will give them fair consideration. I dont know how this would come into play but something that says we are committed to increasing diversity as the goal. 
 Professors who have left/are leaving without tenure - sent an email asking Jenny they have a list of all the faculty that have gone up for tenure/promotion
 Reggie Hill - never went up for tenure and left the department. Now current professor at USC. Example of bad retention record of excellent Black scientists. 
 Zain Syed - denied tenure
 Athanasia - denied tenure and denied an extension of the tenure clock
 Morales - denied tenure 
 That atheist guy that Kimbra was in his lab (Ridenhour maybe)
 McDowell (denied promotion)
 Professors who have gotten tenure - literally somehow alex is the most diverse bc hes shorter(L O L..)- was talking to Alex about this and he said that of the last 6 people up for tenure, the only 2 that got it were white men
 P5: proposed goals: (maybe just have them numbered with 1-2 sentence description/motivation
 Is there a way to request that the Department / College be transparent about tenure and promotion One thing that I think could be relevant in this discussion is where in the promotion timeline people are getting denied (i.e., department-wide vote, college-level, university-level)
 So, for instance, if a lot of people are being denied tenure at the department-wide vote, then the department is actively preventing promotion of diverse faculty members
 I believe at least 2 were denied at levels higher than department 
 Support for URM faculty in dept: If its going on at higher levels, that may point towards a bigger issue in the University, but also suggests that the department is not setting up our faculty members to succeed 
 Unnecessary service requirements (as was mentioned with Athanasia), etc. 
 Or that diverse faculty end up doing a lot more unrewarded service mentoring students that arent their own 
 Other ideas: - larger grad student/postdoc wellness
 what is the breakdown of graduate students (maybe just stick with ecology) compared to ecology faculty. For example, is the ecology faculty representative of the ecology grad students (OBVIOUSLY no, but it would be good to show a statistic)
 Issues: we could get the breakdown of demography from the website, but not sure how we could do that for graduate students, unless we asked ppl to declare it own their own (which in itself may be bad)
 Shut Down Academia it would be good if the entire bio department could get together and take part in this shut down on June 10th (no research, no meetings, no classes, no business as usual). 
 Diversity Statement [source]
 Crislyn linked the departments diversity page in her email, and I personally find it incredibly underwhelming Theres maybe two or three generic sentences about valuing diversity and then a pithy metaphor about biological diversity. Id like one of our proposed goals to be to see an updated diversity statement/page from the department that actually outlines concrete actions taken towards fostering/appreciating diversity. The foundation of a Diversity Committee (in agreement with the below suggestion) with members clearly listed, resources for education for non-minority faculty/staff/students, resources for members of the community who feel they have been subjected to discrimination
 The institution of a Diversity and Inclusion committee is key in ensuring that our department is continually making an effort to provide equity within our department. The first step would be to assess access to equitable opportunities (i.e. what are the barriers currently in place in our department for BIPOC and what have we done thus far to close the gap). 
 One that annually reports - breakdown, efforts, etc. We dont want reports to be quotas though, rather we need cultural change in recruitment and retainment efforts. Rethinking tenure conditions
 Conclusion: Diversity begets diversity. 
 Fostering an environment of transparency will foster an environment of inclusivity
 (Eg no one knowing why Syed was denied tenure and rumors about his religion playing apart)
 Taking actions to actively diversify faculty in the department will have an immediate impact, but will also make the department more desirable for other potential future URM candidates. It could reduce feelings of isolation and create a more inclusive community. It may help recruit diverse graduate students and postdocs (and help retain them). 
 We must do the painful work to dismantle the biases, conscious and unconscious, that allow for systematic exclusion of diverse voices from our community. 
 

Reasons weve heard from other graduate students and faculty regarding why some candidates arent good candidates for TT positions at ND: 
- Voice is too high, wouldnt be taken seriously
- Mentorship and inclusivity of a candidate is good, but research isnt strong enough
- Too intense (in reference to female candidates)
- (re Athanasia) too much service
