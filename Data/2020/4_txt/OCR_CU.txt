Dear 
 Senior Leadership Team, 
During yesterday’s protests to #StrikeforBlackLives, #ShutDownSTEM, and 
#ShutDownAcademia, a group of us brainstormed some concrete, anti-racist actions that we’d 
like to see 
 take. Our organization is not very diverse, and we fear that our current 
environment may not allow for improvement. As a predominantly white organization, we are part of the systemic racism that pervades our country, be it consciously or subconsciously so. We 
are also part of the larger 
 Academia, and Geosciences communities, all of which 
need to make sweeping institutional changes to ensure a more just, equitable, and inclusive future. We must speak up and act on this topic now. If we do not, our silence and inaction make us supporters of racism, violence, and injustice. 
Ideas for action: 
 ?Examine our current strategic goals, mission, and policies with an anti-racism lens. How can we revise these to promote anti-racism?
?Add a goal to the strategic plan to address our own biases as a predominantly white organization. This goal should lay out a multi-phased improvement plan.
?Invite an open dialogue to discuss racism and related issues so that personnel feel that it is safe to speak out.
? Regularly invite feedback from staff with regard to inclusivity and racial diversity within the organization. 
?Provide resources for educating staff about anti-racism and start open dialogue forums, e.g. on Slack, through email, in meetings.
?Post diversity and anti-racist statements prominently online (
social media, our 
website, etc.).
? Acknowledge the pain and suffering of Black people and the multi-tiered problem of systemic racism in our society. Specifically condemn the continued police violence and killings of Black people. 
? Outline the anti-racist steps that we are taking to create a more just and inclusive organization for all. 
?List the steps that 
 is taking to dismantle white supremacy in all its forms.
?Assess where we can increase our efforts and follow through with action.
?Work with 
 Diversity & Inclusion to form a local 
 diversity committee.
?Diversify our leadership and staff. Outline an actionable plan toward achieving this goal and revisit it annually. 
?Have an intentionally diverse recruitment strategy .
?Require unconscious bias training for hiring managers. Consider sponsoring all employees to receive this training.
?Promote anti-oppression training to learn about the history of racism and how we have been taught (across the education system, including universities) to think about racism (https://www.reganbyrdconsulting.com/). For example, bystander intervention training.

?Acknowledge that we are a predominately white organization, ask questions about why we have so little racial diversity in our organization, and then take steps to improve 
diversity (in all its forms) at 
. Are we creating an environment that welcomes 
Black people or people of color? How can we improve?
?Discuss the intersection of environmentalism and social justice, and why these issues 
need to be part of our work at 
.
?Diversify our collaborations:
 ?Encourage scientists and others to form relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, and minority-serving institutions for education, outreach, and recruitment efforts.
?Encourage 
 scientists to attend more meetings organized by people of 
color, e.g. the National Association of Black Geoscientists (http://www.nabg-us.org/) and Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference (http://tapiaconference.org/).
?Invite more Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and other people of color and scientists to 
present at 
. 
?Work with 
 to implement policies and actions to recruit Black scientists and 
other underrepresented groups to apply for the Postdoc Fellowship and Visiting Scholar programs.
?Work to ensure 
 education and outreach is reaching underrepresented groups.
?Make transparent how 
 can/does participate in 
policies and lobbying. In other 
words, what is our path for supporting institutional change on the University level, e.g. the No Time For Silence actions (https://notimeforsilence.org/)
?Look into 
 relations with campus police. Reconsider our own relationship with 
the campus police. Reexamine and prioritize the campus resources that exist outside of police intervention to de-escalate conflict and threats. 
This list is not exhaustive but should be seen as a starting point for efforts that 
 will enact 
over the coming weeks, months, years, and decades. We also were not able to open comment 
to the full 
 community but think it would be valuable for 
 to do this. We hope that 
this list can become an 
 page, open to community input and discussion, and 
a starting point for action and accountability. 
We are hopeful for 
 action. We would like to see the 
 Senior Leadership Team 
take a leadership role on this issue, and we look forward to supporting action and progress. 
Sincerely (in alphabetical order),
