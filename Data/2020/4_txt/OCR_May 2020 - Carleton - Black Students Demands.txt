We, the Black Student Alliance (BSA), African and Caribbean Association (ACA), Men of Color (MOC), and Student Department Advisors for Africana Studies (SDA), seek your immediate action in implementing anti-racist programs, organizations, and spaces for black students, faculty, and staff on campus. 
We, as black students at Carleton, desire to see our institution speak swiftly, clearly, and forcefully about issues that affect the life chances of Black people and the well-being of Black students. This includes explicitly denouncing the racist murder of George Floyd as well as state-sanctioned violence carried out against peaceful protesters. We appreciate that the College has acknowledged the murder of George Floyd; however, it took four days for an initial statement to be released by the College, with a more detailed response issued on June 1, 2020. 
These statements were incredibly disappointing for us and, in our view, are emblematic of the continual disregard we feel as black students at Carleton. This disregard is heightened in these critical moments when there is lethal, excessive, and extrajudicial violence perpetrated against black bodies, almost daily. 
Yet, the College seems to be reluctant and/or unwilling to speak out against police brutality and white supremacy--realities that resonate deeply with black students when, aside from our social lives and studies, we are compelled to focus on the multiple ways that whiteness is weaponized against black people. Against the backdrop of this ongoing pandemic, we have witnessed black people killed by racist whites over the past few months without a statement from the College to express concern or address the challenges and horror it causes for us. 
President Poskanzer has indicated a willingness to begin to address these issues and to engage with several groups on campus, among them the BSA. We acknowledge your enthusiasm and firmly believe this is a time not only to reflect on the white supremacist murders of black people across the country, but also a time to develop meaningful ways to shape better conditions and opportunities for black students and students of color on this campus. In particular, we see an opening for the College to play a vital role in addressing and redressing antiblackness, institutional racism, white supremacy, and microaggressions on this campus and in the Northfield community. 
While there is a ready acknowledgement by faculty, staff, and students of the egregious and heinous nature of the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Michael Brown, and Dana Martin, Matthew Lee, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Chynal Lindsey, and so many others, there also needs to be a recognition that black students at Carleton are not always made to feel safe, supported, or equal to their peers. Members of Black student organizations such as BSA, ACA, and MOC endure persistent racism at Carleton by faculty, staff, and students. Carleton prides itself on diversity, yet we do not see the mechanisms implemented and resources deployed at the College to ensure the safety, security, and viability of domestic and international black students. 
A sampling of the overt discrimination faculty and staff have perepetrated against black students on-campus, and forms of generalized institutional neglect of black students, are enumerated below: 
Faculty Discrimination: Some faculty, mostly white, are not taking seriously the trauma black students are enduring as a result of the recent murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. 
 Cases of Covid-19 have disproportionately impacted black students, and black students who ask for extensions are not granted such. In the Economics department, faculty exhibited continuous cultural incompetency by undermining capabilities and identities in the classroom. Students are led to interpret a faculty members seeming disinterest in building a sense of community that the small, liberal arts college environment encourages as a sign of disregard. This especially happens when faculty fail to learn black students names or advise them adamantly to major in other disciplines outside of Economics. 
Faculty members encourage black students to take a term off when experiencing difficulty. Students have interpreted this to have racist undertones as it conveys the assumption that they are not good enough for Carleton. 
 In the Spanish Department, a faculty actively diminishes and belittles black women and black queer men in the classroom. For example, she called a black woman stupid in class and encouraged black queer men to watch Will Smith videos as an example of a strong black father figure. 
Staff Discrimination: 
  A staff member acted in an anti-black manner, referring to black students with the N-word. 
 Staff members at Bon-app and Alumni Relations (200 Division St) have touched Black womens hair. 
In the Gould Library, a staff member habitually targeted and reprimanded black workers for doing activities that many white workers did, consistently and continuously reported black workers for not finding books promptly, threatened employment, and was condescending and patronizing. 
Inadequate Services:
  BSA was compelled to raise funds to help black students on campus since Carleton did not provide funds explicitly allocated for black students as a relief for COVID-19. 
There is a lack of programs and workshops on campus explicitly held for black students. 




The institution lacks commitment to Black History Month. Since our time at Carleton, the 
college administration has never officially acknowledged this month or the events hosted by BSA, ACA, MOC, and the Africana Studies program. 
To take responsibility for and to demonstrate a commitment to curing the ills of white supremacy, anti-blackness, institutional racism, and microaggressions black students face on and off campus, we demand that the following mechanisms be implemented to promote our safety, our intellectual and social viability, and our overall well-being on campus. 
WE DEMAND that Carleton show an institutional commitment to support and retain extant Black tenure-track faculty, and make an effort to turn visiting professorships and post-doctoral positions into tenure-track positions. 
WE DEMAND to see an institutional commitment to Africana Studies and black student life on campus, conveyed in, for example, widespread participation in, and resources for, Africana Studies Week, attendance at Africana Studies events by professors, and advertisement of Africana Studies as a viable major. 
WE DEMAND the immediate establishment of a Black Center on campus; the Office of Intercultural and International Life (OIIL) is the only space on campus Carleton has provided for people of color that is neither federally-funded (i.e. TRIO) nor supported through a non-profit (i.e. Posse). Many of Carletons peer institutions such as Swarthmore and Grinnell have Black centers at their institution. 
WE DEMAND more resources and funds for OIIL in order to expand programming and create levels of advocacy, initiatives, and workshops for students of color. 
WE DEMAND mandatory anti-racist training for all incoming and current faculty, staff, and administrators. Carleton must contract independent black anti-racist trainers to underscore the importance of racial, gender, and sexual diversity. This training will take place fall and spring term. 
WE DEMAND that Carleton security undergoes mandatory anti-racist training to improve the way that persons in uniform (law enforcement, security, etc.) interact with black people and other persons of color. Anti-racist training must be contracted with an independent black anti-racism educator. 
WE DEMAND efforts to recruit international black students from a greater variety of Caribbean and African countries. 
WE DEMAND funding in the form of grants instead of loans for black low-income students. 
WE DEMAND Carleton makes a substantial donation to small black businesses damaged in Minneapolis due to looting and vandalism. Many of our black students reside in Minneapolis and other parts of Minnesota. Thus, we believe it is essential to restore their communities. 
WE DEMAND more black parents on the Parent Advisory Council. 
WE DEMAND the highest paid administrators give up a percentage of their salary to help address the Colleges fiscal constraints. 
Black Student Alliance, African and Caribbean Association, Men of Color, and Africana Studies Student Department Advisors will be awaiting direct and swift action to implement our demands 

at this institution. If Carleton is sincere in its commitment to cultural and racial diversity, this institution must include anti-racist and Black-centered programs, organizations, and structures to ensure black students on and off campus feel supported and welcomed. 
Standing in Black Power,
