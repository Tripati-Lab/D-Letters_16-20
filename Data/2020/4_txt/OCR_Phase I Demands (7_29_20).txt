Institute a workflow that will go in effect when subsequent national racial trauma1 occurs (which is inevitable) that will center & support Black students and allow them the academic respite that they need. 
For example: This year (June 2020) students were offered the opportunity to pause school (both in FS1 and FS2). We were grateful for this opportunity and even for the students who did not choose to pause schooling, the sense of agency provided by this option was crucial to us. In the future, a workflow could be deployed in which students are offered a break from academic responsibilities for an X amount of days. It is important that Deans emphasize that students will not face repercussions (including biased clinical evaluations) for choosing to take this academic respite and outline how students can make up for the work that they missed during this voluntary respite period. 
Office of Student Health and Counselling Services: Guarantee 10 individual mental health counselling sessions (preferably with therapists of color) for all Black students in need, regardless of how many previous sessions they have already had with this Office, through the end of 2020. 
Allow students to host events that are restricted to only students who identify as Black. 
Creating spaces such as these are important and therapeutic to our community. We have received push-back and censorship in the past when attempting to create Black-only spaces, which are akin to race-based caucusing, a validated anti-racist tool developed to promote healing, growth, and racial equity. These events actively challenge and buffer stereotype threat and imposter syndrome, which are pervasive in communities that are underrepresented in medicine.

toll that this continues to take on students, particularly Black students.
 Declare police violence as a public health issue.
 List what resources are available to support incoming students during this time.
Course Directors: Communicate to pre-clinical students by July 15th 2020 the specific steps they will be taking to incorporate explicit anti-racism curriculum into F1 (beyond H&I and H&S). 
F2/Clinical Students:
Clerkship Directors & Dean Hauer: provide a statement to current rotating students before July 15th 2020 to address the following: 
Acknowledgement of the recent events (re: Police violence and structural racism) and the toll that this continues to take on students, particularly Black students.
Communicate the specific steps they are taking to address discriminatory and racialized assessment practices.
Provide the following data: what percentage of clerkship and clinical site directors have completed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Champion Training What is the average number of hours of training each director has completed
If we have paused our EMLR and LIC work, what does the make up for that look like
 
List: steps that the SOM is taking to ensure that students will not be penalized for 
their time away.
SOM Deans: Grant students with elective credit for work done to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives within the School of Medicine. This includes (but is not limited to) advocacy/activism efforts, curriculum development, and community engagement work. All other electives require 8-10hours of work for 1 unit. 
Identify faculty leaders who can sign off on these efforts for elective credit.
