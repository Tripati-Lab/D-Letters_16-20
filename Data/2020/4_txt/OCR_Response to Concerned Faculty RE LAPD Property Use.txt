Thank you for your recent note and the opportunity to address the concerns. The Chancellor and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost asked me to respond to your letter since UCLA PD is within my portfolio. We are troubled by the accounts outlined in your letter. Please know that the use of the Jackie Robinson Stadium parking lot as a “field jail” was not done with the administration’s permission, collaboration or knowledge. 
As you note in your letter, UCLA leases Jackie Robinson stadium from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, but the university does not own the stadium or its parking lot. From time to time, city agencies like the Los Angeles Fire Department ask UCLA’s permission to use the parking lot as a staging area during fires or other emergencies and we typically grant those permissions. Several weeks ago, LAFD asked UCLA’s permission to utilize the parking lot as a COVID?19 testing area and the university granted that permission. However, UCLA did not receive a request from the LAPD or any other city agency to alter the use of that space last night into a “field jail” for processing arrestees. Our understanding is that LAPD worked directly with the VA, not consulting UCLA. 
I am able to confirm that LAPD has vacated the property and we will inform them that future use as an arrest processing center will not be granted.
