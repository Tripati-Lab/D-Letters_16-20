We, the Black students of the Graduate Division, unite our voices with those in the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry in a fight against anti-Blackness in STEM. A University that espouses to champion principles of community and PRIDE values cannot exist within an institution that perpetuates racial inequities. Science has a racism problem [1] and UCSF is no exception. 
We would like to thank the Graduate Division Leadership for organizing, listening, and responding to the demands of the student petition. It is our goal to continually urge the administration to combat structural racism in an effort to empower current and future Black trainees. We ask that this mission be upheld according to the following demands, which were drafted and edited by graduate students of BE-STEM: 
Action Items for Dismantling Institutional Racism and Achieving Racial Equity for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) Trainees at UCSF 
1. [By Q1 2021] Collect and publish annual demographic data on BIPOC. A transparent record is required to evaluate progress and establish accountability toward racial equity. This annual public report must include: 
 a. Data that resolves the generic reporting of underrepresented minorities (URM), Black/African American, and International for students, faculty, staff and post-docs. Specifically, it must inform on BIPOC identities including, but not limited to: American Descendant of Slavery (ADOS), African-American, Afro-Carribean, Afro-Indigenous, Chicano/a and modeled after the Graduate Divisions Program Statistics . 
b. Details on existing efforts that outreach to and recruit BIPOC scholars, including: conferences attended, universities visited, list of applicants (applied, accepted, and matriculated), and the list of UCSF personnel involved in recruitment. 
Statistics on the demographic enrolled in UCSFs Summer Research Training c.
Program (SRTP) and their matriculation into graduate programs. 
d. Statistics on the demographic of students participating in outreach efforts to primary schools under the umbrella of SEP. 
2. [By Q1 2021] Establish a specific and centralized budget to recruit Black graduate students. Currently, each graduate program independently recruits its graduate students with the expectation that they share the Graduate Divisions commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive student body. Under this system, Black candidates are 
 underrepresented among those invited for on-campus interviews, and, in turn, are 
 underrepresented throughout the incoming classes of most graduate programs. We ask that the Graduate Division take an active role in chartering best practices that can be 
 implemented across graduate programs to effectively recruit and retain Black graduate students.
a.
Establish a paid position within the Graduate Division to develop recruitment 
 pipelines between UCSF and national & international undergraduate and masters degree programs in STEM that predominantly enroll BIPOC students. b. Guarantee annual visits to UCSF, which may function as a recruitment event, for students from these partnering institutions. 
c. Compensate UCSF graduate students for recruiting on behalf of the Graduate Division at SACNAS, ABRCMS, or any other conference. 
3. [By Q1 2021] Expand current programs and develop new outreach initiatives to serve Black communities. 
a. Expand the Science and Health Education Program (SEP) to ensure Bay Area schools disproportionately serving Black students in science are included and financially compensate all its participants for their work and travel expenses. Establish a paid long-term student-mentorship program where UCSF trainees b.
can mentor 1-2 students selected from SEP-partnered classrooms over at least 2 academic semesters, as studies have shown that longer-form mentorship can have a positive impact on Black students transitioning to college [2]. Additional funds should be made available for essential educational resources and meals for participating mentors and students. 
c. Increase awareness of existing educational outreach programs housed by the UCSF Center for Science Education and Outreach (CSEO) and provide equitable financial supplementation for participating mentors/labs as well as transportation and meals for the programs students. 
4. [By Q1 2021] Equitably compensate Black students involved in programming that supports Black communities and/or the academic retention of Black scholars. Black student-mentors and -leaders divert time from their research to fulfill an unmet need in supporting fellow Black trainees. The University is a benefactor of this uncompensated work, which includes retention of Black trainees, that reinforces the sense of community at UCSF. 
We recognize that many organizations at UCSF support BIPOC individuals in STEM. 
However, funding for many of these programs are regulated by GPSA/ASGD and grossly limited. As such, we demand the following: 
 a. University-provided accounts or credit cards to replace the current 
 reimbursement system, which imposes an unnecessary financial burden on trainees. 
b. Bank accounts where additional funds can be directly allocated to RCOs that serve BIPOC learners. These funds should supplement the amount provided by ASGD and GPSA and will aid in community building for current and future Black trainees. 
c. Development of the Diversity Fellows Program 
d. Expansion of mentorship and leadership awards (with financial compensation) e. An annual conference for diversity-oriented RCOs to promote community and develop collaborations. 
5.
[By Q3 2021] Reallocate resources in an equitable fashion to improve the experience 
of Black learners and thereby improve retention. When Black learners are recruited to UCSF, a predominantly white institution, they often struggle to find community, adapt to the high cost of living, and to utilize professional development resources that are often couched in structural racism. These problems are further compounded by structural racism that has engendered socioeconomic disadvantages for Black students in particular (redlining, racist allocation of government grants, etc). UCSF should work as an institution to overcome these structural barriers to the success and retention of Black students by implementing the following: 
a. Invest in infrastructure to support the well-being of Black members of our community. The well-being of Black students will rely, in part, on their access to safe spaces on campus. However, neither of UCSFs campuses provide a physical infrastructure offering reprieve for Black students, particularly at a time when Black Americans are disproportionately persecuted. A financial commitment of $1.5 million should be allocated to identify and/or create such spaces at Mission Bay and Parnassus that are independent of the Multicultural Resource Centers and prioritized for use by Black students. 
b. Emergency/Access Fund: UCSF should make available funds to help students, especially those who are first-generation and low income, to alleviate the stress that comes with covering basic needs, emergency expenses, etc. See Cornell: https://scl.cornell.edu/identity-resources/first-generation-low-income-support 
c. Professional Development Fund: As UCSF claims to be a champion at diversity and inclusion, it is imperative it takes steps to level the scales. As such, UCSF should allocate funds in the form of awards for Black students through diversity-oriented RCOs, such as BE-STEM, which can be used for professional development resources, courses, workshops, or travel. While there are already funds available, this is widespread throughout the student body, and also poorly advertised. By having this guaranteed funding structure, it is easier for Black students to have a conversation with their advisors regarding these experiences, and the barriers to achieving such goals as a graduate student are reduced. Facilitating these interactions and conversations, through materializing a Professional Development Fund will also aid in the retention of Black students. 
d. Legal Aid: Black individuals are more likely to experience negative encounters with law enforcement, and discriminatory practices in numerous settings. Additionally, some Black individuals may have a non-US citizenship status or families outside the US. 
UCSF should acknowledge this hardship by providing and advertising legal resources to Black students. These resources would provide peace of mind and allow students to thrive during their time as a UCSF trainee. 
6. [By Q2 2021] Hire two additional BIPOC clinicians for Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS). Under the guidance of Dr. Jeanne Stanford, SHCS has increased the diversity of its staff and maintains the lowest ratio of counselors to students (1 to 533) in the UC system, in compliance with the International Accreditation of Counseling Services (IACS). However, there is data to suggest that the mental and emotional needs of Black graduate students at UCSF are not being met by the resources provided by SHCS. For 
instance, the recommendations set forth by IACS are intended for traditional universities, which predominantly comprise undergraduate students. Since UCSF is an exclusively graduate institution, adherence to these guidelines may not constitute sufficient mental health resources for our graduate students. Furthermore, graduate students are more than six times as likely to experience anxiety and depression as compared to the general population [3] . Therefore, it is not enough that UCSF is ranked #1 among the UCs; SHCS must be held to a higher standard if we are to effectively support our students. 
 SHCS provide a critical service to non-white graduate students. In the 2019-2020 academic year, 47% of SHCSs clients were graduate students (16% SON, 12% SOM, 11% SOP, 9% SOD, & 5% PT) and 61% of its clients were non-white. According to SHCS, overrepresentation of non-white clients disproportionately burdens POC clinicians, who are requested at noticeably higher rates by POC students. Relatedly, POC students typically forfeit earlier appointments with white clinicians to accommodate the shortage of POC clinicians. For some, however, access to counseling services may be time-sensitive. The need for available therapy has become increasingly urgent amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the disproportionate killing of unarmed Black people, and as our nation collectively reckons its history of racism [4] & [5] . 
7. [Immediately] Fund the salary of the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Learner Success, DAnne Duncan, and increase the number of hired full-time support staff to aid in equity and inclusion measures who serve to benefit Black students in the graduate division from a sustainable and equitable source. DAnne Duncan has operated as the sole DEI advocate for BIPOC students in the Graduate Division, since being hired in 2017. Since then, she has become the administrator and coordinator for a number of DEI efforts in the Graduate Division including (but not limited to): SRTP, IMSD, 
 UC-LEADS. In addition to this programming, DAnne serves as an academic advisor to many BIPOC students and is developing a course for the betterment of all learner 
 experiences. While we appreciate that theres a current search to hire a program manager, we believe that a bigger team is needed to accomplish the necessary work in increasing equity. The university can address this as follows: 
 a. Hire, at least, two staff members dedicated full-time to DEI efforts that come from diverse backgrounds to aid in equity and inclusion measures who serve to benefit Black students in the graduate division . We are aware that UCSF has instituted a hiring freeze for this year. However, the freeze specifically stipulated that [d]uring this period, we will consider exceptions, with a focus on positions that are essential to supporting our mission and operations through this crisis. These words were written while the crisis at the forefront of the minds of many was COVID-19. However, we must also address the constant crisis of racism. On June 9th, Chancellor Hawgood stated that UCSF must continue the hard work of dismantling...structural barriers of racism in education [and] research. We strongly believe that hiring at least two additional support staff, thus expanding the current search, is critical to supporting UCSFs stated mission of educating and supporting trainees of color. 
b.
Change the salary source of the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Learner 
Success, DAnne Duncan, to be more equitable and sustainable and abolish admission fees. Currently, the salary of the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Learner Success, DAnne Duncan, and office related expenses are funded entirely by admission fees. Increasing the amount of fee waivers or removing admissions fees altogether is an effective strategy for recruiting students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Thus, we believe that funding the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Learner Success from a demonstrably exclusionary source, such as admissions fees, is antithetical to UCSF goals of supporting DEI. We request the following changes to remediate this problem: i. A continuous decrease of 5% in the admissions fees yearly and an increase of 20% in the number of fee waivers offered yearly to increase equity during recruitment, with the ultimate goal of abolishing exclusionary barriers of entry 
 ii. A public report on the amount of fee waivers offered and a streamlined process of requesting fee waivers 
 iii. Establishment of a sustainable and equitable funding source for the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Learner Success and its Program Managers 
8. [Immediately] Include and compensate Black students and postdocs in faculty meetings, groups and/or task forces involved in making policy decisions that directly affect trainees, faculty hires, and student recruitment, admission, and retention across all graduate departments and programs 
 a. Trainees should be financially compensated for the time commitment to participate in those meetings. Hours to be compensated include both meeting time and time for prior research, reading materials, slack and email 
 communication required to prepare for these meetings. Hourly payment should start at $20/hr in 2020 and be adjusted yearly according to inflation. 
b. Required participation of a paid expert consultant who specializes and has a background in studying institutionalized racism and/or studies the history of BIPOC people in these task forces to provide scholarly knowledge to 
 discussions, adding depth and context to the opinions of trainees, faculty, and administration. We also ask that these individuals are vetted and agreed upon by diversity RCOs like BE-STEM, and are given decision-making capabilities. Upon discord, these individuals should be granted the ability to act on behalf of the unheard voices from BIPOC graduate students. This position should be 
 respected and their voices should be heard, whether they relay the voice or experience of one student or more students, to avoid serious experience dilution problems, that overtime lead to and perpetuate gaslighting, and loss in retention of Black students 
c. The task force should also include members that have knowledge of what university policies are currently in place, of the history of implementing such policies and know how quickly suggestions can be taken into action under the current policies 
d.
Task Forces should meet with the Chancellor Executive team soon after the 
establishment of the committee to present recommendations that need to be enacted immediately (30-day suggestions) and follow-up meetings to assess whether recommendations were enacted and successful to address the issues. 
9. [By Q1 2021] Implement transparent and easily accessible policies and actions for recognition and reporting of racist actions or behavior (including suspected) of any UCSF employee to be met with repercussions and/or punishment for these offenses. 
a. We demand the creation of a post similar to a CARE advocate that can help navigate the policies regarding filing a complaint about discrimination and harassment specifically regarding race, so complainant knows what to expect before filing a complaint 
b. Codifying common discriminatory behavior [6] (microaggression x harassment x discrimination x retaliation) and its corresponding punishment (reduction of salary, demotion, suspension, dismissal, among other sanctions outlined in APM 016) and rehabilitation. These rules should be laid out publicly on the OPHD, ODO, Academic Senate, Graduate Division and Postdocs Office websites, and communication of them should be part of training events for faculty and trainees. 
c. Discriminatory actions that result in reduction in salary should result in reallocation of reduced salary to the initiatives listed above. 
d. Transparency regarding the process to remove problematic faculty with the Academic Senate. Per the sanctions outlined in APM 016, we require that faculty found repeatedly guilty of discrimination and harassment on the basis of race to be punished with the most severe sanction: dismissal. Retaliatory practices should result in dismissal even if the accused faculty had no previous complaints. 
10. [By Q2 2021] Defunding and divestment of the UCPD, reallocating funds to build alternative roles to address the needs of UC students, faculty, and employees and to items outlined in 2 through 7 . 
a. Some students have grown up in neighborhoods that were over policed and the police presence at UCSF is retraumatizing. Theres no empirical data that we can rehabilitate racist police, however, theres empirical evidence that implicit bias training does not lead to behavior change [7] , [8] therefore the only solution left is to remove problematic police officers and security guards on campus. Therefore, we ask that UCSF reduce police force on campus by 30%- 50% this year and freeze hiring for 5-years; reassess thereafter. 
b. With the reduction in the police force, reallocate funds following this successful example 
We look forward to your prompt response.
