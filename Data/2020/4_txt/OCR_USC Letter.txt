Members of our Trojan Family are under attack and have been for years. Black people across the country risk their lives every time we leave our homes. A simple drive up the coast, a jog in our neighborhood, or even studying late near the Parkside Fireplace brings unwanted and unwarranted attention from police, whether it?s DPS or LAPD. This is the reality of so many of us?your classmates, your students, your teachers, and your friends. The unrest in America now is the culmination of the fear, the frustration, and the anger that Black people across the world have wrestled with every day. We have decided to no longer be silent as Black people across America continue to be lynched by those sworn to serve and protect. We are asking that you, our fellow Trojans, join us and use your voices as well, because to be silent is to be complicit. To be neutral in situations of injustice is to choose the side of the oppressor. BSA would like to make it clear that we support the mission of the Black Lives Matter movement and protestors across the nation. 
Though we are spread across the globe, we can still come together, as a family, to advocate for each and every one of our civil rights. Whether you choose to advocate by protesting, by donating, by spreading awareness, or any other combination of advocacy you see fit, we urge you to advocate and to do so safely. 
To use your voice, your privilege, and your resources, to help right the wrongs of this country. If reforming the country seems too daunting for you, then we urge you to start with our own community at USC.
We are working with the Undergraduate Student Government to ensure that USC is a safe environment for all students, both physically and psychologically. Below, we will list the work we are doing to advocate for our Black Trojans, because even though we are under USG?s programming department, our advocacy comes first.
Actions BSA is taking: 
 1.We are working with USG to host community conversations and education surrounding how to be an ally that will be open to all USC students 
 2.We will be hosting conversations for Black Trojans where they can grieve, organize, and process as a community 
 3.We are working with DPS to start an open dialogue between students and officers 
 4.We will be sending Calls to Action to our community partners 
 5.Fundraising efforts for Freedom and Bail Funds across the country 
Call to action for the greater USC community: 
 1.Check in on your students, teachers, peers, and others affected 
 2.We stress that the Von KleinSmid Center (VKC) and other buildings named after known eugenicists be changed, as there is no way for marginalized students to feel fully welcome on a campus that displays the names of those who fought against them 
3.We want to see all community offices and organizations who in any way serve the black population show support by sharing resources, financial or otherwise 
4.We want administration and DPS to foster an environment where students feel safe filing reports against DPS officers who have profiled or otherwise mistreated them 
5.We want the bookstore to apologize for its callous advertising of a ?We Fight as One? sweatshirt and its attempts to profit off of the pain and suffering of Black Trojans 
6.We want all faculty, administrators, trustees, and incoming students to take part in a racial bias training run in part by USG and BSA 
7.We want DPS to re-evaluate the extent of its relationship with the LAPD and the threat that it poses to our black students 
8.We want USC to take a stand against police brutality and the unjust treatment of Black people across the globe through more than just words. Financial donations to organizations like Black Lives Matter or increasing the resources made available to Black students is just one of the ways that USC should show its support 
This is a chance for all of us to use our voices. To show the world who we are. To be the change we want 
to see. To make a difference. We hope we?ve inspired you to join us.
